        All dependencies of the package. This option should be set by the "outer world" and can be used to inherit attributes from `pkgs` or `inputs` etc.

        By separating the task of retrieving things from the outside world, it is ensured that the dependencies are overridable.
        Nothing will stop users from adding `nixpkgs` itself as a dependency, but this will make it very hard for the user of the package to override any dependencies, because they'd have to figure out a way to insert their changes into the Nixpkgs fixpoint. By adding specific attributes to `deps` instead, the user has a realistic chance of overriding those dependencies.

        So deps should be specific, but not overly specific. For instance, the caller shouldn't have to know the version of a dependency in order to override it. The name should suffice. (e.g. `nix = nixVersions.nix_2_12` instead of `inherit (nixVersions) nix_2_12`.
